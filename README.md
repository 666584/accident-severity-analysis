# Accident Severity Analysis

This repository contains a project titled **"Analysis of Road Environment Factors Affecting Accident Severity"**, originally developed for the subject *COMP20008* at the University of Melbourne.

## 📊 Overview

This project investigates how various road environment factors affect the severity of traffic accidents. Key variables include:

- **Road type**
- **Intersection type**
- **Speed limits**

Using data pre-processing, correlation analysis, and machine learning models, we aimed to understand the relationship between these environmental factors and the severity of accidents.

## ⚙️ Methods Used

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding)
- Correlation analysis
- Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means Clustering
